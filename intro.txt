We do not provide any information about probabilities of occurrences. These would be hard to determine and depend on many unknown factors.
We do not provide severity information or any other risk classification, because severity is highly subjective (e.g. scarring might be acceptable for one, and a big problem for others).
Determining risk acceptance criteria is up to the users.
We do not provide information about how specifically a measure is to be implemented. Providing accurate information about every measure would overload this project.
We do not provide links to additional resources. Checking links for accuracy would overload this project.
